This site contains my notes for competitive programming.

The notes are meant to be sparse and aim to cover a wide range of topics without going into too much detail.

There is no order to the notes and are mostly meant for reference.

If you want to actually learn the concepts mentioned here, I would suggest looking at some of these resources:
- [CPH](https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf)
- [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/)
- [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/)

But the most important thing is to [practice](practicing.md).
