title: Practicing
---
- During a contest most of the time should be spent on thinking, so practice implementation in order to implement quickly and correctly.
- Problems should be of the appropriate difficulty: either you should struggle for a while before coming up with a solution, or you miss it slightly and need to check the editorial for some small part.
- It's fine to "give up" (i.e., read the editorial) as long as you gave yourself enough thinking time (a good baseline is 20 to 30 minutes) and have made several attempts.
- Don't read the entire solution at once, read it step-by-step and implement it yourself.
- Learn something from every problem (e.g., new algorithm or idea, implementation trick, a bug), even if very small.
- **Understand how you could have come up with the solution yourself.**
