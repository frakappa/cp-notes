# Casework

A casework problem is one that can be broken into different cases that can each be solved for separately.

These problems usually require drawing out a lot of cases and making observation about each.

We can try to spot similarities between the cases in order to arrive at a more general approach.

It is often useful to sort or "normalize" the input in order to reduce the number of cases to consider.

Some ways that a problem can be broken down in cases are:
- The array is sorted; the array is not sorted.
- A number is the minimum; a number is not the minimum.
- Two values are equal; the first value is smaller than the second value; the first value is greater than the second value.
